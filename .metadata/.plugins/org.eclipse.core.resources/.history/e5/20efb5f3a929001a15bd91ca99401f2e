//What this extends keyword?
//This is called inheritance it inherits the methods and variables from Example2.
//So if you see extends keyword it means there is an inheritance relationship here.
//Usually example1 bottom class the one it extends(Example2) is called the super class.
public class Example1 extends Example2 {
	
	String name;
	//So this is a polymorphism.One method could be same name an other method but with different parameters
	//There are two polymorphism.
	//1 - Overloading(Same name but with different parameters)
	//2 - Overriding

	//And this is a overriding.It takes this one instead of the other one.
