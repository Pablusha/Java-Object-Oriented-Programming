# Object Oriented Programming
# Polymorphism
There are two polymorphism in Object Oriented Programming.
* Overloading (One method could be same name an other method but with different parameters)
* Overriding (Overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.)
# Inheritance
Inheritance is inherits the methods and variables from an other class.This process uses to "extends" keyword.
So if you see extends keyword it means there is an inheritance relationship between classes
# Getters And Setters
That's called encapsulation.Variables are usually has private access.The easier way to access the private variables we using getters and 
setters methods.
# Interfaces
Interfaces is a list of variables and methods.Just know that.If you want try the inheritance interface to class you have to use 
"implements" keyword.
